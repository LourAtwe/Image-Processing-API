# Image-Processing-API ðŸ“¸

This project is a simple Image Processing API that lets you resize images dynamically through URL parameters.

 ###FeaturesðŸš€

Built with TypeScript for type safety and cleaner code.

Resize images dynamically using a powerful image processing library.

Caches processed images for faster response on repeated requests.

Easy integration with any frontend framework or static site.

### NotesðŸ“–

Place your images in the images folder before making requests.

If the requested resized image already exists, the API serves it directly (faster).
