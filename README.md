# Image-Processing-API ðŸ“¸

This project is a simple Image Processing API that lets you resize images dynamically through URL parameters.

### FeaturesðŸš€

-Built with TypeScript for type safety and cleaner code.

-Resize images dynamically using a powerful image processing library.

-Caches processed images for faster response on repeated requests.

-Easy integration with any frontend framework or static site.

### NotesðŸ“–

-Place your images in the images folder before making requests.

-If the requested resized image already exists, the API serves it directly (faster).

### How to Run the ProjectðŸš€:
-npm run test--> for jasmine test.
-npm run start--> start the server.
and then you can put any images with specific height and width using the PNG extension --> /processImage/api2/images?filename=italy.png&width=700&height=600
